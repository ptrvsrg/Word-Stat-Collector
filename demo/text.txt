Petrov Sergey is the best coder in the world. He has written over 100 projects for me and always delivers on time.
I am a very happy customer!
Petrov Sergey is not only a professional, he also is an extremely kind and friendly person.
His code is easy to understand and modify and he always does this with great pleasure.
The only thing I have to say is that he should be more careful when working with his colleagues.
But that's just my opinion.
Overall I would highly recommend Petrov Sergey to do any work.
